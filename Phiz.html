		<div class="description">If there is one thing that we and the universe can agree upon is <b>time</b>. Time a thing so relitive to each mechanism in the universe.It has driven a path for all modern day sciences. From the start of how we understood gravity through great minds like <em>Sir Isacc Newton</em> to understanding <em>General Relitivity</em> through the brilliance of <em>Albert Einstien</em>. Time has lead us to further understanding of the mechanics of the universe.Through centreys and decades of new ideas and technologies science has brought not only answers but predictions to the modern world that where propsed by great minds before us.</div>

			<div class="description" >The stars in our galaxy are like immassive clues that the universe has left us to solve it. Although scientist have learned so much about the universe and the stars it hold, there are still many stars and galaxies that have not been discovered. Scientist use stars and galaxies not only to find possiblity of more life but also, possility at new elements and energies that may be pondering our universe. After all most of the <em>visable energy</em> from the universe if from exploding stars that shine 100x brighter than a a active star. Like humans stars goes through a life cycle. At the end of a stars cycle it explodes giving off elements essential for life.</div>

			<div class="description">A <b>universe</b> with billions of galaxies. In those galaxies hold billions of stars. This along with mega-galaxies make up most of the mass for the observable universe. <em>Mega-galaxies</em> are galaxies that start out as thier own and over time merge into one. Like the new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HXMM01#/media/File:HXMM01.jpg">mega-galaxies HXMM01</a>. This galaxy started as two and and merged into one. Things like this happen all the time in the universe simply because the  universe is accelerating. Since the observable part of the universe only makes up a small portion of the total mass of the univere. There is a <em>non visable</em> part of the universe with a substantial amount of mass calculating most of the mass in the universe. </div>
